    Meta context manager: args are context managers, kwargs go to `setenv`.

    If any kwargs are given, they are passed directly to an invocation of
    `setenv`; if any args are given, they (along with the invocation of
    `setenv`, if any) are sent to `contextlib.nested`.

    What this means is that `settings` may be used to combine multiple
    Fabric context managers such as `hide` or `show`, with the functionality of
    `setenv` thrown in for convenience's sake (so users do not have to
    explicitly call `setenv` as well, when combining it with other context
    managers.)

    An example will hopefully illustrate why this is considered useful::

        def my_task():
            with settings(
                hide('warnings', 'running', 'stdout', 'stderr'),
                warn_only=True

                if run('ls /etc/lsb-release'):
                    return 'Ubuntu'
                elif run('ls /etc/redhat-release'):
                    return 'RedHat'

    The above task executes a `run` statement or two, but will warn instead of
    aborting if the `ls` fails, and all output -- including the warning itself
    -- is prevented from printing to the user. The end result, in this
    scenario, is a completely silent task that allows the caller to figure out
    what type of system the remote host is, without incurring the handful of
    output that would normally occur.

    Thus, `settings` may be used to set any combination of environment
    variables in tandem with hiding (or showing) specific levels of output, or
    in tandem with any other piece of functionality implemented as a context
    manager.
