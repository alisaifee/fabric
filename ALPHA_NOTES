Scratchpad for stuff to say about the alpha and recording feedback about same
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Should be 100% equivalent in functionality to 0.1.1, EXCEPT for the handful
  of things which I explicitly removed such as require()-as-a-decorator, the
  depends() decorator, and etc.
  * Is there anything I'm missing still?
  * Do you disagree with any of the omissions? If so, why, and please provide 
  a real-world use case if possible. Also keep in mind that one of the reasons
  for stripping things down is...so we can build them up again from this new
  foundation :)
* Execution model: see "Make execution model more robust/flexible" bullet near
  bottom of MAGIC-REMOVAL_TODO. Want people's thoughts on how they do or would
  like to structure their fabfiles, in terms of execution order, and what host
  lists should apply when.
* Module layout: general feedback appreciated here. Make sense as-is?
